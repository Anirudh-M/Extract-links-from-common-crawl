# Extract links of required domain from common crawl
Common Crawl is a corpus of web crawl data composed of over 25 billion web pages. It conducts regular web wide crawls of the open web and preserves all of the content it downloads in the standard WARC file format. Unlike many other archives, it focuses primarily on preserving HTML web pages and does not archive images, videos, JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, etc. Its goal is not to preserve the exact look and feel of a website on a given snapshot in time, but rather to collect a vast cross section of HTML web pages from across the web in a single place to enable large-scale data mining at web scale.
